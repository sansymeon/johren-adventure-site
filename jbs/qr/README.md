# Johren QR System – Intent & Constraints (READ BEFORE CHANGING)

This document exists to prevent future over-engineering, gamification,
or accidental drift away from Johren’s core principles.

If you are reading this, slow down.

This system is intentionally quiet.

---

## 1. Purpose of QR Codes in Johren

QR codes in Johren exist for **access**, not engagement.

They serve to:
- quietly mark that a place participates
- allow discovery to continue beyond a scan
- create a minimal memory of presence

They do NOT exist to:
- reward users
- track individuals
- encourage repeated behavior
- optimize engagement
- create competition

---

## 2. Levels (Internal Only)

QR levels are an **internal structural tool**, not a public feature.

### Level 01 – “Peace Boat” Level
- One universal QR code
- No merchant identity
- No visible visit counts
- Used for:
  - stations (JDS)
  - passive participating places (JBS)
- Represents:
  “This place allows Johren to exist here.”

Level naming (`level_01`, etc.) is intentionally neutral and boring.
Do not rename to marketing terms.

---

### Level 02 / Level 03 (Future, Optional)
- Unique QR codes per location
- May expose limited information **only to the place owner**
- Still no public metrics
- Still no user-facing explanations

These levels exist only as **potential extensions**.
They are not commitments.

---

## 3. Visit Data Philosophy

Johren may record **occurrences**, not behavior.

### What is recorded
- A QR code was accessed
- A station was visited
- A place-level QR was accessed

### What is NOT recorded
- Who accessed it
- How often a person accesses it
- Paths, sequences, or correlations
- Rankings or comparisons

Visit data exists as **memory**, not feedback.

---

## 4. Visibility Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Users NEVER see numeric visit counts.
- Users NEVER see progress indicators.
- Users NEVER see thresholds.
- Users NEVER see explanations for symbols or changes.

If numbers are shown publicly, this system has failed.

---

## 5. Delayed Effects (If Ever Used)

If a visual change ever occurs:
- It must happen **after time has passed** (e.g. next day)
- It must not occur immediately after scanning
- It must be subtle (icon, image, quiet presence)
- It must not be explained

No instant feedback.
No dopamine loops.

---

## 6. Merchant Autonomy

Johren does NOT:
- issue rewards
- validate offers
- enforce benefits
- manage promotions

If a merchant chooses to recognize something:
- that decision is entirely theirs
- Johren is not involved
- this must remain clear in small print

Johren provides infrastructure, not incentives.

---

## 7. Things You Must Not Add Later

If you are considering adding any of the following, stop:

- leaderboards
- streaks
- achievements
- badges with explanations
- “almost there” messaging
- analytics dashboards for users
- calls to action based on counts

If it feels “smart”, “engaging”, or “optimizing” —
it probably doesn’t belong here.

---

## 8. Final Reminder

Johren works because it is calm.

Do not make it loud.
Do not make it clever.
Do not make it persuasive.

If in doubt:
- remove a feature
- delay it
- make it quieter

Presence is enough.
